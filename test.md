# Sample Document

This is a test document with various links to test the link-summoner tool.

Here's an existing link that should be skipped: [Google](https://www.google.com).

Then, let's add a link to [React hooks](React hooks tutorial for beginners).

Finally, let's link to [Go documentation](official Go programming language documentation).
