# Sample Document

This is a test document with various links to test the link-summoner tool.

First, let's link to [Go documentation](official Go programming language documentation).

We also want to reference [Python's requests library](documentation for making HTTP requests in Python).

Here's an existing link that should be skipped: [Google](https://www.google.com).

Finally, let's add a link to [React hooks](React hooks tutorial for beginners).
