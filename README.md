# link-summoner
This tool assists you in keeping you in the flow state while writing a Markdown document.

Rather than needing to fill in the link URL, you can describe in plaintext the URL you're looking for. When you run link-summoner, it will run an AI flow to find the URLs you've described and replace them with the actual URLs.
