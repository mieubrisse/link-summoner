# link-summoner
When writing in Markdown, stopping to fill in link URLs can distract you into your browser.

To keep you in the flow state, you can drop plaintext into the link URL (between parentheses) and then clean them up later with this tool.

For example, you might write:

```
The [Revolutionary War](revolutionary war wiki)

This tool keeps you in the flow state by letting you drop plaintext into the link URL, and then 

Rather than needing to fill in the link URL, you can describe in plaintext the URL you're looking for. When you run link-summoner, it will run an AI flow to find the URLs you've described and replace them with the actual URLs.
